# 🚗 AI Automotive Consultant — Intelligent Car Specs Advisor

Welcome to **AI Automotive Consultant**, an advanced AI-powered platform designed to help users make informed decisions when buying a car. 

Leveraging a multi-agent architecture orchestrated by LangGraph and powered by Groq’s LLM models, this system dynamically retrieves detailed car specifications and generates insightful, buyer-focused evaluations.

## 🔍 Project Overview

AI Auto Consultant integrates state-of-the-art technologies to deliver personalized and comprehensive car advice. The platform consists of two intelligent agents working in harmony:

- **Spec Retriever Agent**: Fetches accurate car specifications from a curated dataset.

- **Evaluator Agent**: Uses Groq’s large language models (LLM) to analyze the retrieved specs and produce detailed, easy-to-understand evaluations tailored for potential buyers.

This setup exemplifies how AI agents can be orchestrated effectively to solve complex real-world problems by combining retrieval and generative AI in a seamless workflow.


## ⚙️ Technologies & Tools Used

- **LangGraph**: For building a modular, stateful multi-agent workflow with clearly defined execution nodes and state transitions.

- **Groq LLM (via langchain-groq)**: To provide natural language understanding and generation capabilities, powering the evaluation logic with advanced reasoning.

- **Python**: Core programming language for implementing the agents, workflow orchestration, and integration.

- **dotenv**: For managing sensitive environment variables like API keys securely.

- **CSV Data**: Curated car dataset containing key specifications such as price, mileage, and fuel type to simulate a real-world automotive database.


## 📈 Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Demonstrates the power of LangGraph for coordinating agents with defined roles and data flow.

- **Dynamic Contextual Evaluation**: Uses Groq LLM to interpret car specifications and generate nuanced buyer advice.

- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily scalable to include more agents, data sources, or richer context for deeper analysis.

- **Clean, Maintainable Codebase**: Well-structured and modular to facilitate rapid development and future enhancements.
